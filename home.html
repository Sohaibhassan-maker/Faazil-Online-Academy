<h2>About the Founder</h2>
<p>
Sohaib Hassan – Founder of Faazil Online Academy – is an experienced and passionate educator who has been teaching online since 2020. After completing his bachelor's degree, he began his journey in education by offering home tuitions. With consistent dedication, he soon gained the trust of families, and those same homes referred him for online tutoring opportunities. This positive momentum encouraged him to establish a strong presence on freelancing platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, where he successfully connected with students from across the globe.

Over the years, Sohaib has had the privilege of teaching students from a wide range of academic backgrounds and syllabuses, including:

Khan Academy (US), SparxMath (UK), MathRose (UK), Hegarty Math (UK), Carnegie Learning (US), Mathia (US), Aleks Math (US)
Eide (UK), MyMaths (UK), IGCSE Additional Mathematics and Pakistani National Curriculum.

Currently, Sohaib is also serving as a mathematics teacher at an IB (International Baccalaureate) school in Wah Cantt, District Rawalpindi, Pakistan, where he teaches both IB PYP and IGCSE AQA-level classes.

Inspired by his journey and driven by a vision to expand the impact of quality education, he founded Faazil Online Academy. His goal is to build a professional teaching team that not only excels in academic subjects but also specializes in Islamic education. With qualified faculty for Qur'an and Islamic Studies, the academy aims to serve Muslim students both nationally and internationally by providing expert-led online learning in both secular and religious subjects.</p>
